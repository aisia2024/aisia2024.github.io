    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      In recent years, as AI technology has achieved great success in the field of natural image analysis, AI-based
      surgical image analysis has also attracted more and more attention from researchers. Surgical image analysis is
      close related topic to ICPR, and is very important area in the ICPR community, because surgical image analysis is
      essential for the quickly developed surgical assistance and autonomous surgical robot domains. Surgical image
      analysis has its unique characteristics compared with other image analysis tasks, like analysis for natural
      images,
      face images, or document images. The development of surgical image analysis methods requires special designs
      w.r.t.
      the surgical image content and structure. There are also increasing studies that adapt pretrained models for
      natural
      images to surgical image analysis. We believe organizing such a workshop can attract researchers in the related
      area
      to improve the methods and techniques of other domains and design new methods to solve problems in surgical image
      analysis.This Artificial Intelligence for Surgical Image Analysis (AISIA) workshop will be held at ICPR2024 during 
      December 1st-5th, 2024 at Kolkata, India.

    <h2 id="paper-submission-instructions">Paper Submission Instructions</h2>
    <!-- <p><strong>Submission and Review</strong><br /> -->
    <h3>Submission and Review</h3>
    <p>
      ICPR-2024 will follow a single-blind review process. Authors can include their names and affiliations in the
      manuscript. Also, the authors can submit their arXiv papers in ICPR-2024.</p>
    <!-- <p><strong>Paper Format and Length</strong><br /> -->
    <h3>Paper Format and Length</h3>
    <p>
      Springer LNCS format with maximum 15 pages (including references) during paper submission. There is no minimum
      page
      limit. To take care of reviewersâ€™ comments, one more page is allowed (without any charge) during revised/camera
      ready submission. Moreover, authors may purchase up to 2 extra pages. Extra page charges must be paid at the time
      of
      registration.</p>
    <p>Springer LNCS paper formatting instructions and templates for ICPR-2024 are available here <a
        href="upload/ICPR_2024_DOC_Templates.zip">DOC</a> and <a href="upload/ICPR_2024_LaTeX_Templates.zip">LaTeX</a>.
    </p>
    <!-- <p><strong>Supplementary materials</strong><br /> -->
    <h3>Supplementary materials</h3>
    <p>By the submission deadline, the authors may optionally submit additional material that was ready at the time of
      paper submission but could not be included due to constraints of format or space. The authors should refer to the
      contents of the supplementary material appropriately in the paper. Reviewers will be encouraged to look at it, but
      are not obligated to do so.</p>
    <p>Supplementary material may include videos, proofs, additional figures or tables, more detailed analysis of
      experiments presented in the paper. There is no page limit for the supplementary materials but only one file with
      maximum file size of 50 MB is allowed for submission.</p>
    <p>We encourage (if possible) authors to upload their code as part of their supplementary material in order to help
      reviewers assess the quality of the work.</p>
